In this mob, we aim to learn Rust by going through the Exercism Rust track, and other exercises.  
We are a mix of new and experienced developers, seeking one additional mobber to learn Rust with us (beginner or experienced).
We require some familiarity with basic programming in another language and an attempt/initiative to read the Rust language book: https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/

Optionally, we also meet on the weekends to learn about how Rust works with the Solana blockchain (schedule varies).
