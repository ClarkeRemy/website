Mob Otter is the most frequently occurring mob, at five days a week.
Together with Mob One we have released the first open source project that is product of Mobus Operandi, the Rust crate michie.

Nowadays we are continuing work on michie that is following feedback we received.

We are currently five members and open to more. Experienced developers only. Experience with Rust not required.
