## What we do

We work on an [open source webapp](https://github.com/gregorriegler/mob-programming-rpg) for the Mob Programming RPG.  


## How to join

Just show up. We're happy to onboard new contributors.  
Go to the README and check out the "[Contribute](https://github.com/gregorriegler/mob-programming-rpg/blob/main/README.md#contribute)" section.  

There you will find a calender invite to add the event to your calendar.  
And it contains the access to our gather town where we meet and work together.
