  ## What we do

  We are currently working on [the Mobus Operandi website](https://mobusoperandi.com) which is [statically generated using Rust](https://github.com/mobusoperandi/website).
status: !Open |
  ## Join us
  
  We're currently only two, so we're definitely interested in expanding.
  You'll be learning/practicing web development using Rust.

  If the current is too much for you, you don't have to participate in all of it.
  
  To apply, please contact [Dawn](https://twitter.com/mightyiam).
