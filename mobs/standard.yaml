  ## What we do

  Even though we are titled ‘standard’, we currently work on specifically [eslint-config-standard-with-typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-standard-with-typescript).

  ## The pay

  This mob is not currently funded.
status: !Open |
  ## Join us
  
  We are currently only two, so we are definitely open to more participants.
